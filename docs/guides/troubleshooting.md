# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to resolve them.

## First Steps

For any issue, start with:

```bash
adjutant doctor
```

This checks dependencies, credentials, file permissions, and service state. It's read-only and won't modify anything.

If doctor reports problems:

```bash
adjutant setup --repair
```

Repair mode detects what's broken and fixes it.

## Listener Issues

### Listener won't start

**Symptoms**: `adjutant start` exits silently or reports an error.

**Check**:
```bash
adjutant status
```

**Common causes**:

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `KILLED` lockfile exists | Run `adjutant startup` (not `adjutant start`) |
| Another listener already running | Run `adjutant stop` first, then `adjutant start` |
| Missing credentials | Check `.env` has `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` |
| OpenCode not found | Install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and ensure it's on PATH |

:::warning
`adjutant start` will refuse to start if a `KILLED` lockfile is present. Use `adjutant startup` for recovery -- it clears the lockfile, restores crontab, and starts fresh.
:::

### Bot doesn't respond to messages

**Check in order**:

1. Is the listener running? `adjutant status`
2. Is it paused? Look for `PAUSED` in the status output. Run `adjutant resume`.
3. Is the chat ID correct? The bot only responds to the chat ID in `.env`.
4. Check the log: `adjutant logs` -- look for errors or "rejected unauthorized sender"
5. Rate limited? Adjutant limits to 10 messages per 60 seconds by default.

### Listener crashes repeatedly

Check `state/adjutant.log` and `state/listener.stderr.log` for error details. Common causes:

- Invalid bot token (Telegram returns 401)
- Network connectivity issues
- OpenCode process crashes

If using LaunchAgent (macOS), the service will auto-restart. Check crash frequency with:

```bash
adjutant logs
```

## KILLED State

### How to recover

```bash
adjutant startup
```

This clears the `KILLED` lockfile, restores crontab from backup, re-syncs schedules, starts the listener, and sends a recovery notification.

### What triggered the kill?

Check the log around the time of the kill:

```bash
adjutant logs
```

Look for `[control] Emergency kill` entries.

## Scheduling Issues

### Cron jobs not firing

1. Verify crontab is installed: `crontab -l`
2. Check if jobs are enabled: `adjutant schedule list`
3. Re-sync: `adjutant schedule sync`

### "opencode not found on PATH" in cron

Cron runs with a minimal `PATH` (`/usr/bin:/bin`), which typically excludes
directories like `/opt/homebrew/bin` where `opencode` is installed. Adjutant
snapshots your interactive shell's `PATH` when installing cron entries (via
`adjutant schedule sync`), so re-syncing usually fixes this:

```bash
adjutant schedule sync
```

As a fallback, you can set `OPENCODE_BIN` to the absolute path of the binary:

```bash
export OPENCODE_BIN=/opt/homebrew/bin/opencode
```

### macOS Full Disk Access

On macOS, cron needs Full Disk Access to run scripts that access files outside standard directories.

**Fix**: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access > add `/usr/sbin/cron`

### Jobs fire but produce no output

Check the job's log file (shown in `adjutant schedule list`). The log path is defined in the schedule's YAML config.

## Model / AI Issues

### "Model not found" errors

The configured model may not be available in your OpenCode setup. Check:

```bash
adjutant status
```

Look at the current model. Switch to a known working model:

```
/model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
```

### Model switch doesn't persist

Model changes via `/model` are stored in `state/telegram_model.txt`. They persist across restarts but not across `adjutant kill` + `adjutant startup` (which resets state). Set the default model in `adjutant.yaml` instead:

```yaml
llm:
  models:
    cheap: "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"
```

### Responses are very slow

- Check which model is active with `/model` -- expensive models (Opus) are slower
- Switch to a cheaper model: `/model cheap`
- Check if OpenCode is healthy: `opencode --version`

## Knowledge Base Issues

### KB query returns empty or errors

1. Check the KB exists: `adjutant kb list`
2. Check KB info: `adjutant kb info <name>`
3. Verify the KB path exists on disk
4. Try a direct query: `adjutant kb query <name> "test question"`

### KB not auto-detected in chat

The agent uses KB names and descriptions to detect relevance. Improve auto-detection by giving your KB a descriptive `description` field in `knowledge_bases/registry.yaml`.

## Rate Limiting

### "Slow down" messages

Adjutant limits to 10 messages per 60 seconds by default. Wait a minute and try again. This protects against accidental message floods and excessive API usage.

## File Permission Issues

```bash
adjutant setup --repair
```

Repair mode checks and fixes:
- CLI executable permissions
- Directory permissions
- Missing directories

## Getting More Help

- Check the [commands reference](/docs/guides/commands) for correct usage
- Read `state/adjutant.log` for detailed error information
- Run `adjutant doctor` for a comprehensive health check
